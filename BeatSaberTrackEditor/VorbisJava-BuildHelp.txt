While attempting to use Vorbis I created this note sheet.
I could not get the .jar to work with processing, but here are the steps that I followed when creating the .jar

Download VorbisJava project (A Java Vorbis implementation)
https://github.com/Gagravarr/VorbisJava

Create a new project in eclipse.
In the "src" directory of this new eclipse project, copy the folder "org" from 
VorbisJava-master\tools\src\main\java\

Project might have warnings, but there should be no errors 

Export as jar
Put jar file in 
C:\Users\username\Documents\Processing\libraries\VorbisJava\library\VorbisJava.jar
The folder name in \libraries\ must match the name of the jar file

import into Processing using

import org.gagravarr.ogg.tools.*;
